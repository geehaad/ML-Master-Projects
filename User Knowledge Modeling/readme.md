<h1>Overview:</h1>
<ul>
<li>- The goal of this project is to predict user knowledge by
coming up with a model based on variables to classify the
level of user knowledge.
<li>- Alongside factors such as exam performance, degree of study
time and other such features, we want to explore the effect
these factors have on predicting the user knowledge level
(UNS).
</ul>

<h1>The Work:</h1>
1. Investigate the dataset:
- Visualization.
- Preprocessing.
- Encode Categoric column_ Label column: “UNS”.

 2. Feature Selection:
 - Correlation Matrix
 - univariate Feature Selection or Testing applied statistical tests.
 - coef. Parameter in SVM.
 3. Modeling and evaluation:
 - SVM.
 - Perceptron.
 - OVR-SVM.
 - OVO-SVM.
